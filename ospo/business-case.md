# UCL's Open Source Programme Office

*Executive Summary*
> help them understand the project’s purpose, benefits and implications. Some components of an executive summary include the project overview, business need, proposed solution to the need, cost estimate, return on investment, risks, timeline and a call to action.

## Context

> context for your project, explaining the problem that it's meant to solve and how it aligns with the organisation's vision and strategic plan

UCL has a long history of open-source software development for research and open-source educational materials.

In a recent study, we identified more than a thousand open-source projects owned[^1] by the UCL community that are directly related to UCL research, publications or teaching, on the GitHub platform.
The oldest of these projects dates back to 1997, notably before the invention of git itself, and is still one of our most active projects today.

[^1]: _TODO define 'owned' jargon here (or reword)._

## What is an OSPO

## Why does UCL need an OSPO? / What benefits does it give?

*mission statement*
> You’ll need to define your project vision, goals and objectives.

Publicly available and licensed reusable material is increasingly understood as a research output or project deliverable.

*explain how it fits a niche or serves a need*

> What is the risk of not having one?

A major risk that an OSPO mitigates is a legal one.
One of the mandates of an OSPO is to develop an informed organisation-wide strategy for licensing open source projects and to provide guidance to developers and maintainers.
In our study, we noted 36.1% of UCL's open-source projects are unlicensed.



## How would it work at UCL?

### Plan 

- 3-year plan, 5-year plan, beyond

*project definition*
> provide general information about your projects, such as the business objectives that will be achieved and the project plan outline. It offers a comprehensive overview of the project including its objectives and scope. Here, include details such as the objectives, stakeholders, scope, expected outcomes and constraints.

*project plan*
> Figure out the tasks you’ll have to take to get the project done. Estimate how long it will take to complete each one.

*risk assessment*
> identify and analyse the risks associated with your project activities. From there, you can assess the likelihood and impact of each and rank them based on this information. The risk assessment makes it easier to focus on the most pressing risks and includes a mitigation strategy to reduce the impact in case the risk comes to fruition.
#### Activities 

*project scope*
> all the tasks and deliverables that will be executed in your project to reach your business objectives

*project schedule*
> a timeline for the project by estimating how long it will take to get each task completed. Gantt chart

*Marketing Strategy*
> distribution channels, pricing, target customers, among other aspects of your marketing plan or strategy.


#### Resources
*project budget*
> Your budget is an estimate of everything in your project plan and what it will cost to complete the project over the scheduled time allotted. Personnel costs, software or hardware costs, consulting fees, training costs and contingency funds

*Financial Appraisal*
> explain how the financial benefits outweigh the project costs.


### Organisation

*Project Governance*
> ll the project management rules and procedures that apply to your project. For example, it defines the roles and responsibilities of the project team members and the framework for decision-making.

*Communication Plan*
> The communication plan can help foster an atmosphere of transparency and engagement among stakeholders. The plan outlines how, when and what will be communicated so that everyone is informed and has a shared understanding.
*Progress Reports*

### Supporters
