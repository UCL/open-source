2025 started strong with our participation in [FOSDEM][fosdem25].
Whereas in 2024 only I (David PS) went, this year we sent a delegation of 9 ARC members, giving 3 talks in different devrooms by Chris and Miguel.
Also, during that weekend, we started talking with Clare Dillon, community manager from [CURIOSS][curioss], a community of University and Research Institution OSPOs.
By April, UCL was already part of CURIOSS.
In a similar manner, after a conference Mosè attended last year, we become in February associate members of the [High Performance Software Foundation (HSPF)][hspf], a hub for open source high performance software supported by the Linux Foundation.


In April we put together a proposal for [Measuring Impact of UCL's Open source for Data Empowered Society][OSPO-DES] led by ARC and NIU to work out Open Source impact in and by UCL.
Unfortunately the proposal was not successful, but its development helped to strengthen contacts across the university and beyond.
A part of what was proposed there was then repurposed as an ARC internal seed project which was successful and we analysed almost 1,000 repositories developed within UCL.


Though a few people in UCL has been involved in the Google Summer Of Code, this year marks the first when a department within UCL got accepted as an organisation, NIU got XX GSoC contributors working on various of their Open Source projects.
Before the application period closed  we run an [informative event where we invited all the known GSoC mentors within UCL][ucl-gsoc] to talk about their projects.
At the end of the summer at least three UCL members (Sofia for NIU, Saransh for NumFOCUS and David for Open Astronomy) attended at the GSoC mentor summit in Munich, Germany.
The summit was an opportunity to meet other participating organisations and Google's OSPO team.


But NIU didn't stop at GSoC! They run [the first Open Software Week][niu-osweek], a week long in-person workshop where they run a set of training sessions on the tools they develop and maintain, together with a career clinic and finished with a hackday.
The event was a success and they've already [announced the second edition for 2026][niu-osweek26].


If this was not enough for a successful year for NIU, their [Brain Globe initiative was awarded the 2025 International prize by the Neuro-Irv and Helga Cooper Foundation][bg-award] last October.


Regarding Open-Source activities, Miguel Xochicale lead a full-day workshop on [Healing Through Collaboration: Open-Source Software in Surgical, Biomedical and AI Technologies][surgical-ws].
This year was also when [UCL's Linux User Group][ucl-lug] was formed.
Started as a Linux Install party in March and have hosted monthly events since the academic year started, helping students and staff to give a new life to their old laptops.
We also double the number of good-first-issue-athons from last year.
Additionally, we run one during the [ARC's Festival of Digital Research, Innovation & Scholarship][arc-festival] in June and another one at the start of December.


As an OSPO, we co-led with CURIOSS a Birds of a Feather session at RSECon titled ["Discovering Academic Open Source"][rsecon-bof] -which outcome will be available early next year- and participated as speaker in the workshop ["From code to contributions: exploring open source culture in academia"][rsecon-osacademia].

And we've collaborated with the [OpenForumEurope][ofe] in the recording of the first masterclass for the OpenForum Academy.
You will see it when it gets published sometime in 2026.


<!-- We received Todd Grappone from UCLA's OSPO (Oct '24) and Stephen Walli from Semester of code (Feb)  -->
Finally, this year we've got a draft for UCL's OSPO business case, which we will be finishing and presenting it next February at UCL's Open Science & Scholarship Committee.


2026 will be a year of celebration, let's make UCL's 200 anniversary the start of a centralised OSPO.
