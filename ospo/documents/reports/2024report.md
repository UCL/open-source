In October of 2021 I received a scholarship to attend [OSPOCon Europe in London][ospocon21].
This scholarship was provided by the [Sloan Foundation][sloan] where they were looking to support the development of Open Source Programme Offices (OSPOs) in university contexts.

Before I attended that conference I knew very little of what an OSPO was, I was aware, however, of some Open Source efforts in universities like the defunct [OSSWatch][osswatch] in University of Oxford or the [CRISOL][crisol] group in Carlos III university in Madrid.

In that conference I heard about the OSPO at the Rochester Institute of Technology ([Open@RIT][rit]), and it was in that instant that I saw that UCL should have one too! 
Mostly as much of the things we do in ARC is aligned with what Open@RIT was doing, but also because we need to have a body to advocate for Open Source within the university and collaborate with other institutions on those matters.
On that conference I also learnt other things like [Inner Source][w-innersource], what OSPOs are outside the academic context and much more.

However, it was not till this year when things started to fall in place to move the creation of an OSPO in UCL. 
Mostly, thanks to the Open Source Research Toolkit funding from ARC's research themes that we got this year.

All started in a conference marathon in February where I attended four conference in a week, [CHAOSSCon][chaosscon24], [EU Open Source Policy Summit][euosps2024], [FOSDEM][fosdem24] and the [State of Open Con][soocon24].
Attending to those conference provide me with a set of contacts that helped me understand what was required and next steps.

One of these person was Jacob Green from [OSPO++][ia-ospo++], a network of OSPOs in universities, governments, and civic institutions.
He was essential on knowing what to do.

Thanks to him we organised the first Open Source Breakfast Club in London where few of us from UCL met various Open Source community representatives (CHAOSS, EOF, Matrix, Moodle, Mozilla, FINOS, OpenUK) and discussed what interactions could a University have with those communities (read [the whole report of the first open source breakfast][ossbclub] in London).
Additionally, thanks to Jacob I managed to get a spot at [UN's OSPO for good symposium][ospo4good] and [What's next for Open Source?][NYworkshop] workshop.
Those two events helped us to understand how organisations such as UN, national and local governments, industry and research institutions collaborate through OSPOs to tackle the [Sustainable Development Goals][sdg] ([read our report of the OSPO for good][ospo4good-report]).

Between Jacob and I, we organised a panel at the [Open Source , Ethics & Innovation in AI][turing-event], a Turing's Way Practitioner's event hub last November in London.
There, besides count with the participation of [Digital Science][ds], the French goverment OSPO, [FINOS][finos] (the fintech open source foundation), the [Tech Transfer and Open Source office from Coppin State University][coppinU] and with UCL's [Miguel Xochicale][mxochicale] giving a perspective on Open Source and medical tech transfer.


This year we submitted three talks at various events through out the year, and the three were accepted.
They were at [UCL Open Science & Scholarship Conference][ucl-osci], [ARC's Festival of Digital Research, Innovation & Scholarship][arc-fest] and at [RSECon24][rsecon].
All of them were well received and sparked the conversation about Academic OSPOs within UCL and UK universities.


Additionally, as per the numerous open source contributions happening in UCL, I'd like to mention the one from last summer by Saima Abdus.
Saima has been ARC's first ever [In2Research][in2research] intern, and worked with ARC and NIU RSEs [expanding BrainGlobe's atlas with Axolotl's brain][bg-axolotl].
Also, this year was when the Science Clusters launched the first [OSCARS Open Call for Open Science projects and services][oscars] and our colleague David Stansby was one of the awardees for the [HEFTIE (Handling Enormous Files from Tomographic Imaging Experiments) project][oscars-heftie].
And just before Christmas we run in ARC the first [Winter OSS Good-first-issue-athon][arc-gfi], an event to introduce to people to contribute to Open Source projects tackling issues that they need help with.


Overall, this year has been a good start towards the OSPO.
Full of activities and outreach to find OSPO supporters between the university and the open source community.
Let's see what 2025 brings.
