# Open Source Programme Office

<section class="content-box news-summary">

An open source programme office is a office which handles an organisation's open source strategy, policy and operations.
In a university, it acts as a hub for developers and researchers who want to make open source software, open source research software, open educational materials and more.

</section>

[We](../people/) are working towards creating a formal open source programme office for UCL.
Since we believe in open development, our [draft business case](./documents/business-case), and all of our [talks, proposals, applications](./talks-proposals) (including rejections!) available to browse.

If you're from UCL and want to get involved, please [email us](mailto:open.source@ucl.ac.uk), or contact the ARC collaborations team via [MyServices](https://myservices.ucl.ac.uk).
