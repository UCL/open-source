# UCL and open source

UCL currently[^1] has no official policy on licencing software. 

UCL retains the intellectual property of any software written by members of staff but does not object to sharing software under open source licences.
The relevant section of the [intellectual property policy document is Section 2.1](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/staff/policies-supported-innovation-enterprise/ucl-intellectual-property-ip-policy).

<!-- note that the link in the internal docs page:

https://www.ucl.ac.uk/enterprise/about/governance-and-policies/intellectual-property-ip-policy/intellectual-property-policy-guidance#Software

is now 404 :-(

-->

[^1]: We're working to change this with an [Open Source Programme Office](../ospo/).

## [ARC](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc) and open source

The [Centre for Advanced Research computing](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc) recommends that people always add a licence and copyright to any software that is produced and shared with a third party.
However ARC does not offer legal advice.

### Which licence ?

We you start with [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).
We've also found [the European Commission's tool for comparing software licences](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/solution/joinup-licensing-assistant/jla-find-and-compare-software-licenses) to helpful for comparing compatibility of different licences.
You should also check your dependencies to see what licences they use, and ensure that your chosen licence is compatible with them.

### Applying the licence

Avoid modifying the text of the licence you choose.
We have seen instances in the past where people have customised a licence, which has inadvertently rendered the software unusable from a legal standpoint.

### Copyright

Software created by staff represents an "intellectual asset" for the university.
Many licenses have a line for the copyright holder.
In such cases, you should use either:

> "Copyright [year] UCL"

or 

> "Copyright [year] University College London".

The copyright holder of a piece of software is different if the developer is a student when the code is written rather than an employee of the university (or any other company for that matter).
In such cases, and particularly for collaborative work, the IP ownership and licensing should be discussed earlier and a written agreement reached, as changing this later can be very complicated!

### Where to get legal advice

UCL has a [legal services team](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/legal-services/)  who can be contacted for detailed advice.
