The [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) has created a great opportunity for Research Software, including all those that support Open Science.
This [Research Software Maintenance Fund](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes/research-software-maintenance-fund) has got Â£4.8 million to fund small and large projects.
This is not only for developing software, but to build the community needed to keep the software sustainable.

Get your Expression of Interest ready by the 30th of May, and remember that the teams at [ARC](https://ucl.ac.uk/arc) are available if you need help.
