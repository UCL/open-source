A couple of weeks ago various members of ARC attended [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/), the amazing festival of Open Source and some of its satellite events.

Read the posts that three of our members wrote on their return:

- [FOSDEM 2025: A Weekend of Talks, Conversations, and Controlled Chaos](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/fosdem25-wrap-up/) by Chris Gutschow
